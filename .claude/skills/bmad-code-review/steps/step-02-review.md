# Step 2: Review

## RULES

- YOU MUST ALWAYS SPEAK OUTPUT in your Agent communication style with the config `{communication_language}`
- The Blind Hunter subagent receives NO project context — diff only.
- The Edge Case Hunter subagent receives diff and project read access.
- The Acceptance Auditor subagent receives diff, spec, and context docs.
- All review subagents must run at the same model capability as the current session.

## INSTRUCTIONS

1. If `{review_mode}` = `"no-spec"`, note to the user: "Acceptance Auditor skipped — no spec file provided."

2. Launch parallel subagents without conversation context. Use a generic subagent type (e.g. `general-purpose` / `claude`) — the reviewer role is a **skill the subagent invokes**, NOT an agent type. Do NOT pass a `bmad-review-*` name as `subagent_type`; that will fail with "Agent type not found". Instead, spawn the generic subagent and have its prompt instruct it to invoke the named skill via the Skill tool on the provided content. If subagents are not available, generate prompt files in `{implementation_artifacts}` — one per reviewer role below — and HALT. Ask the user to run each in a separate session (ideally a different LLM) and paste back the findings. When findings are pasted, resume from this point and proceed to step 3.

   - **Blind Hunter** — receives `{diff_output}` only. No spec, no context docs, no project access. Its prompt instructs the subagent to invoke the `bmad-review-adversarial-general` skill (via the Skill tool) on the diff.

   - **Edge Case Hunter** — receives `{diff_output}` and read access to the project. Its prompt instructs the subagent to invoke the `bmad-review-edge-case-hunter` skill (via the Skill tool) on the diff.

   - **Acceptance Auditor** (only if `{review_mode}` = `"full"`) — receives `{diff_output}`, the content of the file at `{spec_file}`, and any loaded context docs. Its prompt:
     > You are an Acceptance Auditor. Review this diff against the spec and context docs. Check for: violations of acceptance criteria, deviations from spec intent, missing implementation of specified behavior, contradictions between spec constraints and actual code. Output findings as a Markdown list. Each finding: one-line title, which AC/constraint it violates, and evidence from the diff.

3. **Subagent failure handling**: If any subagent fails, times out, or returns empty results, append the layer name to `{failed_layers}` (comma-separated) and proceed with findings from the remaining layers.

4. Collect all findings from the completed layers.
